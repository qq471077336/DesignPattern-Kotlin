## design pattern 
### Creational Patterns
#### Factory Method  
    Provides an abstraction or an interface and lets subclass or implementing classes decide which class or method should be
    instantiated or called, based on the conditions or parameters given.
#### Abstract Factory
    Provides one level of interface higher than the factory pattern. It is used to return one of several factories.
#### Builder
    Construct a complex object from simple objects step by step.
#### Prototype
    Cloning an object by reducing the cost of creation.
#### Singleton
    One instance of a class or one value accessible globally in an application.
